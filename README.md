# JoeCool_Password_Generator

## Description

As part of week 3 challenge, I'm tasked with providing password based off a user's input which defines the criteria the password shall have. This challenge will provide the basic fundamentals for javascript such as functions, case statements, and loops, while interacting with a basic html document. 

## Installation

No installation is required. This is a web based tool and can be accessed through [JoeCool Password Generator](https://joecool-engineer.github.io/JoeCool_Password_Generator/).
